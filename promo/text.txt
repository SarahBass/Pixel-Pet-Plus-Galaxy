Earn steps to power up your very own Pixel Pet!

Pixel Pet Plus is based on the old-school 'virtual pet' craze of the 90's. Galaxy Pixel Pet starts as an egg, hatches, evolves, and finally grows into a cute digital monster. When you reach your step goal, your pet will be fully transformed! Look at the heart meter to keep track of your progress.  Clean up after your pet by shaking your wrist. The cleaner the pet, the nicer its final form will be!

Don't Forget to shake wrist (vigorously) to scare away the planet's monsters and protect your little Galaxy Bear! You might encounter snakes, robots, or bear thieves.
